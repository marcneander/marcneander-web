I built my first computer in 2004. Got hooked on webdevelopment during first year of upper secondary school and did a few small websites while in school. One of them was the school network website.</p>\n            <p>More or less right after school I started working fulltime as a webdeveloper, and have been since. I label myself a frontend developer because of my expertise in that area, but my skills are broader than just the frontend.</p>\n            <p>I’m a quick learner and love to explore new technologies to help develop myself further. I see myself as social and driven. I like setting and working toward goals.</p>\n            <p>Away from work I spend most my time rock climbing. If not that, I go running, traveling or simply having a beer.</p>\n            <p>Here’s my <a href="https://github.com/marcneander">Github</a> account.
