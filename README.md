# marcneander.se
Small presentation website of myself

## Get up and running
1. npm install && bower install
2. gulp


### Notes
`/build/` directory is in the code because of pushing that content as subtree to the gh-pages

TODO:
- Lint the code
- See over styling for resum√©
- See over the hack with html5Mode true with using 404.html on github hosting.
