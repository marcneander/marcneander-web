            <h3>Resumé</h3>
            <p>Born 90’ in Stockholm, Sweden. I built my first computer in 2004. Got hooked on webdevelopment during first year of upper secondary school and did a few small websites while in school. One of them was the school network website.</p>
            <p>More or less right after school I started working fulltime as a webdeveloper, and have been since. I label myself a frontend developer because of my expertise in that area, but my skills are broader than just the frontend.</p>
            <p>I’m a quick learner and love to explore new technologies to help develop myself further. I see myself as social and driven. I like setting and working toward goals.</p>
            <p>Away from work I spend most my time rock climbing. If not that, I go running, traveling or simply having a beer.</p>
            <p>Here’s my <a href="https://github.com/marcneander">Github</a> account. Unfortunatly, I’m not allowed to open source things I do at work.</p>

            <h4>Technical Skills</h4>
            <p>Down below I’ve just spat out frameworks, technologies and applications that pops in mind. The idea was to show you that I know a lot. Chances are that I’ve missed a few.</p>

            <p>Working closely with Blocket to launch it’s concept over the world. Being the Venture team for Schibsted we worked in a lean and efficient way to launch in over 16 markets during two years time.</p>
            <p>Many of these launches has successfully grown into number one positions.</p>
            <p>I take care of our frontend, making sure it’s flexible and stable enough to support each market and it’s languages. I’ve for example made sure Internet Explorer 6 worked well for our arabic speaking market (direction: right-to-left).</p>
            <strong><small>Lead frontend developer (2015 jan - present)</small></strong>
            <p>Running out of mature markets to launch, we shifted over to make sure our products were kicking ass. Soon after this change I became in charge of the frontend department.</p>
            <p>Our small frontend team of 4 people have been doing a great job launching new features and making sure our frontend is up to date with great UX and simplicity.</p>
            <p>My tasks have slightly changed, now I spend a portion of my time making sure the team is motivated and happy, but I do code a lot aswell.</p>
            <p>I’ve attended two leadership courses during 2015 which has given me great insights to become a better leader for my team.</p>

                <small>Founder and owner (2008 - present)</small>
            </strong>
            <p>I started a company called MarcNeander when I was 18.</p>
            <p>On my sparetime I sometimes do websites for smaller companies. Mostly because I’ve encountered a new technique or framework I’d like to test out. I shouldn’t completely deny the money though.</p>
            <p>Lately since I’ve taken on more responsibility, there hasn’t been a lot of activity in the company.</p>
